# MNIST-Digit-Recognition
The popular MNIST dataset is used for the digit recognition task using different machine learning algorithms such as KNN and SVM with HOG features. A simple feed forward neural network is also used for comparision with the machine learning models. A detailed report in IEEE format is also provided.
