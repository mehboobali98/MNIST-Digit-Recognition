# MNIST-Digit-Recognition
The popular MNIST dataset is used for the digit recognition task using different machine learning algorithms such as KNN and SVM with HOG features. A simple feed forward neural network is also used for comparision with the machine learning models. A detailed report in IEEE format is also provided.

| Model  | Accuracy |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| KNN (k=3)  | 99.97  |
| SVM (poly kernel)  | 98.38  |
| FFNN | 97.98 |
